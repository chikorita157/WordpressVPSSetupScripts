# What is this?
These are a collection of scripts to easily setup a hosting enviroment suitable for running Wordpress. We intend to make the process more automated so that users do not need to copy or enter in commands. It's meant to make virtual private hosting not only more accessible to people, but also secure.

## Server Requirements
* Ubuntu 20.04 or later
* Root Accesss
* SSH keys generated (Password Authentication is disabled by default)
